# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as markdown files in `docs/issues/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `docs/issues/<feature-slug>/`
- The PRD is `docs/issues/<feature-slug>/PRD.md`
- Implementation issues are `docs/issues/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## Publishing an issue

Create a new file under `docs/issues/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed).

## Fetching a ticket

Read the file at the referenced path. Normally the path or the issue number is passed directly.
